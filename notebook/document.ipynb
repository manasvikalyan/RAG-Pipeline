The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5].

Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [18] and conditional\\ncomputation [26], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 16]. In all but a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [11]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [28].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers.

To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization.

We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention.

Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[31, 2, 8].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [24]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\n5'),\n",

We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [8] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [11]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[31] and byte-pair [25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\n6'),\n",

Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [15], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2).

For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [31]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length.

For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours.

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [31]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [31].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'),\n",

In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\n9'),\n",

This research \\npaper introduces a groundbreaking approach to automating \\ncustomer service using LangChain, a custom LLM tailored for \\norganizations. The paper explores the obsolescence of traditional \\ncustomer support techniques, particularly Frequently Asked \\nQuestions (FAQs), and proposes a paradigm shift towards \\nresponsive, \\ncontext-aware, \\nand \\npersonalized \\ncustomer \\ninteractions. The heart of this innovation lies in the fusion of \\nopen-source methodologies, web scraping, fine-tuning, and the \\nseamless integration of LangChain into customer service \\nplatforms. \\nThis \\nopen-source \\nstate-of-the-art \\nframework, \\npresented as \"Sahaay,\" demonstrates the ability to scale across \\nindustries and organizations, offering real-time support and \\nquery resolution.

INTRODUCTION \\n“Customer is king” is the ancient mantra reflecting the \\nsignificance of customers in every business. In the digital age, \\nwhere the rhythms of modern life are guided by the pulse of \\ntechnology, the realm of customer service stands as the \\nfrontline of engagement between businesses and their clientele. \\nIt is the place where queries are answered, problems are \\nresolved, and trust is forged. \\nThis research paper brings the future of customer service, \\nwhere \\nautomation, \\npersonalization, \\nand \\nresponsiveness \\nconverge to redefine the customer-company relationship. At \\nthe heart of this transformation lies the integration of LLMs, \\nexemplified by LangChain [1]. \\nIn the annals of customer service history, FAQs and \\ntraditional support mechanisms have long held sway. These \\nvenerable tools have dutifully served as repositories of \\ninformation, attempting to address the queries and concerns of \\ncustomers. However, as we stand at the cusp of a new era in \\ncustomer service automation, it becomes abundantly clear that \\nthe traditional methods once hailed as revolutionary, are \\ngradually becoming obsolete. \\nThis paper is an invitation to envision a future where \\ncustomer service is not a cost center but a wellspring of \\ncustomer satisfaction and loyalty. We propose an open-source \\nframework that can be scaled to any industry or organization to \\nfulfill the consumer needs for support and query resolution \\nwithin seconds. \\nFor demonstration purposes, we use the information \\npresented by Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya (BVM) \\nEngineering \\nCollege \\non \\ntheir \\nwebsite \\nhttps://bvmengineering.ac.in/ as the context for our chatbot, \\nfrom where it can retrieve all the information in real-time and \\nanswer to any queries that are raised by the users. Here, users \\ncan be anyone ranging from prospective students, current \\nstudents who intend to get information from the Notice Board, \\nresearchers who wish to search for their potential research \\nguide, and so on. The applications are endless. \\nII. LITERATURE SURVEY \\nS. Kim (2023) et al addresses the challenge of deploying \\nresource-intensive large neural models, such as Transformers, \\nfor information retrieval (IR) while maintaining efficiency. \\nExperimental results on MSMARCO benchmarks demonstrate \\nthe effectiveness of this approach, achieving successful \\ndistillation of both dual-encoder and cross-encoder teacher \\nmodels into smaller, 1/10th size asymmetric students while \\nretaining 95-97% of the teacher\\'s performance [2]. L. Bonifacio \\net al (2022) highlights the recent transformation in the \\nInformation Retrieval (IR) field, propelled by the emergence of \\nlarge pretrained transformer models. The MS MARCO dataset \\nplayed a pivotal role in this revolution, enabling zero-shot \\ntransfer learning across various tasks [3]. \\nThis paper proposed a novel open-source approach to \\nbuilding LLM Chatbots using custom knowledge from the \\ncontent in the website. It is unique in several ways: \\n1. We propose an open-source framework which is robust \\nwith the type of dataset available on the webpage or \\nthe web of links. \\n2. This implementation aims to compliment the use of \\nFAQs with a more interactive and user-friendly \\ninterface. \\n3. We then do a comparative study of various models, \\ntheir performance on the provided data relative to the \\nexpected response from the LLM.'),\n",

METHODOLOGY \\nThis section covers the data collection, details about the \\nselected model, fine-tuning, and integration with the Gradio \\nAPIs for web deployment. \\nA. Data Collection \\nTo gather the necessary data for our project, we employed \\nBeautifulSoup web scraping techniques to retrieve publicly \\naccessible information from an organization’s homepage. We \\nobserved this page is often linked with all the relevant \\ninformation required for the user/visitor. This approach \\nallowed us to collect a wide array of data, including customer \\nservice FAQs, product manuals, support forums, chat logs, \\nassociated institutions, and so on. This data further serves as \\nthe context for our LLM. \\nB. Embeddings \\nEmbeddings play a pivotal role in the development of any \\nLLM powered. They are vector representations of words or \\nphrases in a continuous mathematical space that capture \\nsemantic and contextual information, allowing the model to \\nunderstand the meaning and relationships between words, \\nwhich is essential for providing meaningful responses to user \\nqueries. \\nWe have used HuggingFace Instuct Embeddings – \\n“hkunlp/instructor-large” a text embedding model fine-tuned \\nfor specific tasks and domains, such as classification, retrieval, \\nclustering, and text evaluation [4]. What sets Instructor apart is \\nits ability to generate tailored text embeddings without \\nrequiring additional fine-tuning. These embeddings are then \\nstored using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) library \\nthat allows developers to quickly search for embeddings of \\nmultimedia documents that are similar to each other [5]. \\nC. Language Model \\nWe have chosen Google’s Flan T5 XXL as the most \\nappropriate language model after comparing with other Flan T5 \\ndistributions to retrieve knowledge from the vectorspace and \\nchat_history (or memory) [6]. The model retains the context of \\nprevious messages and uses that as a reference to predict \\nanswers for the upcoming questions. This helps users to have \\nan interactive conversation with the chatbot, instead of a \\nmonotonous and robotic one. \\nD. Integration with Customer Service Platforms \\nA simple chat window can be activated at the corner of any \\nwebsite which would enable users to interact with the chatbot \\nand ask any relevant questions or doubts regarding the \\norganization. However, for the demonstration purpose of this \\npaper, we are using Gradio API framework [7]. \\nIV. RESULTS \\nIn this section, we mention the metrics of comparison, \\nprovide comparative analysis, and use cases in association with \\nan educational institution. \\nA. Evaluating the Performance of LLMs \\nIt is relatively difficult to evaluate LangChain agents, \\nespecially when trained on large chunks of context datasets for \\ninformation retrieval.

Follow-up question \\nB. Applications \\nCustomer service establishes a direct connection between \\nthe customer and the company. It retains customers and \\nextracts higher value from them. By harnessing the power of \\nLarge Language Models as shown in Fig. 2, customer service \\ncan be elevated to new heights, facilitating efficient, \\npersonalized, and responsive interactions. The LangChain fine-\\ntuned over custom knowledge of the product, service, or \\norganization can effectively address a wide array of customer \\ninquiries and issues. Its ability to understand context and \\nhistory empowers it to provide personalized support to \\ncustomers. Automated customer service powered by LLMs is \\navailable around the clock and is also proficient in multiple \\nlanguages. \\nV. CONCLUSION \\nIn the ever-evolving landscape of customer service, the \\nintroduction of Sahaay’s innovative approach presented in this \\npaper, using LangChain as a prime example, ushered in a new \\nera of automation. Automating customer service using \\nSahaay’s open-source Large Language architecture leveraging \\nLangChain revolutionizes the customer-company relationship \\nand CX. It enables companies to provide efficient, \\nFig. 2. User interface – Gradio framework\"),\n",
